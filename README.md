# 🐧 Linux Configs & Fixes

Welcome to my **Arch & general Linux configs** repo!  
Here you’ll find:

- ⚙️ **Dotfiles & configs** for my daily setup (Omarchy + Hyprland)
- 🛠 **Fixes & tweaks** for common Linux issues
- 📜 **Guides & scripts** to make life on Linux smoother

Feel free to explore, adapt, and share.  
PRs & suggestions are always welcome! 🙌
